## Features 

### The Three types of Tasks

Duke supports three different types of Tasks: ToDos, Deadlines, and Events. 

#### ToDo

A ToDo is a simple type of task, that you plan to do, but don't really have a strict due date for. It just has a name.

#### Deadline

A Deadline is a task which needs to get done by a certain date. For example, most homework has due dates and as such
 would be ideal for storing as a Deadline. It has a name, and an associated due date/time. 
 
#### Event

An Event is a task which will be done at a certain date and time. For example, you may have a meeting with some
 colleagues at a certain time, and this should be stored as an Event. Like a Deadline, it has a name and an
  associated date and time.
